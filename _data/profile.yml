  <p>
    I'm an interdisciplinary researcher working at the intersection of computational mechanics, artificial intelligence, and material design. 
    I explore how physics-informed neural networks and topology optimization can be combined to create intelligent and multifunctional structures for advanced engineering applications.
  
  
  <p>
    In addition, I am also exploring the design of multifunctional intelligent metamaterials based on zero-energy modes.
    By introducing zero-energy modes into material design, aiming to precisely control the elastic potential energy and deformation pathways,
    enabling the material to exhibit high tunability and adaptability under external stimuli.

  <p>
    Currently, I am seeking opportunities for joint <strong>Ph.D. training abroad</strong> and plan to pursue international research experiences <strong>before 2027</strong>.
    I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Solid Mechanics at the <a href="http://www.micromechanics.cn/" target="_blank">Laboratory of Wave Dynamics</a>(Zhuhai, China), 
    under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=rtH1n44AAAAJ" target="_blank">Gengkai Hu</a>.
    Prior to this, I obtained a Master’s degree in Energy and Power Engineering from <a href="https://aerospace.xmu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">the School of Aerospace Engineering, Xiamen University</a>.
    I am deeply grateful to my Master’s supervisors, Prof. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6162-9193" target="_blank">Huagang Luo</a> and
    Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ddL-8yMAAAAJ" target="_blank">Cunfu Wang</a>, for their invaluable guidance and support during my graduate studies.
