description: >-
  In aero-engine blade design, the key goal is lightweighting. Lattice structures can be filled within the structure without changing its shape, providing lightweighting and enhancing local performance. This project investigates different topological forms of lattice structures and integrates them into large, highly curved, thin, and lightweight engine blades.
  My project Responsibilities are developping different lattice structures using implicit functions, and conduct experiments on tensile, compressive, and impact specimens to select the best lattice unit. Extracting the blade's external shell and internal filling regions using grid size control and distance field methods. Employying density-gradient-based mesh refinement techniques to locally refine lattice boundaries for high-precision filling. Removing irrelevant grids in lattice void regions for efficient filling. Designing lattice fillings for blade components, bird strike panels, and tension-compression experimental parts.
