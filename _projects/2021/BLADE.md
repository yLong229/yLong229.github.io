description: >-
  In aero-engine blade design, the key goal is lightweighting. Lattice structures can be integrated within the structure without altering its shape, thereby achieving lightweighting and enhancing local performance. This project investigates various topological forms of lattice structures and incorporates them into large, highly curved, thin, and lightweight engine blades. My project responsibilities include: Developing different lattice structures using implicit functions and conducting experiments on tensile, compressive, and impact specimens to select the best lattice unit. Extracting the blade's external shell and internal filling regions using grid size control and distance field methods. Employing density-gradient-based mesh refinement techniques to locally refine lattice boundaries for high-precision filling. Removing irrelevant grids in lattice void regions to optimize filling efficiency. Designing lattice fillings for blade components, bird strike panels, and tension-compression experimental parts.
