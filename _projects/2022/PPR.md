description: >-
  Programmable Poisson’s Ratio Metamaterials are formed by repeating traditional materials in space with specific geometric patterns, exhibiting controllable Poisson’s ratio and low-frequency vibration suppression. This project explores design methods for programmable Poisson’s ratio metamaterials based on composite functions, investigates reverse optimization methods for metamaterial filling under desired deformation, and incorporates low-frequency vibration suppression in structural design. My project responsibilities include: Designing 2D and 3D programmable Poisson's ratio metamaterials based on composite periodic functions, using PDE filtering techniques to ensure compatibility between different metamaterials. Studying the macroscopic material properties of metamaterials using homogenization methods. Developing a neural network surrogate model for metamaterial material properties using PyTorch. Investigating reverse filling distribution and topology optimization for metamaterials under desired deformation, and researching multi-objective topology optimization considering both stiffness and frequency.
