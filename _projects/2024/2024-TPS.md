description: >-
  This project focuses on the design of multi-level composite lattice sandwich structures for strong laser protection, incorporating surface coatings, thermal insulation filling, and a metallic skeleton. The goal is to create a structure that combines resistance to laser thermal ablation and mechanical failure, while also ensuring lightweight, load-bearing capabilities, and integrated thermal protection. This structure aims to enhance the laser resistance of aerospace vehicles, missile defense systems, and other equipment. My project responsibilities include: Designing lattice unit cells, including TPMS types, typical bar-type structures, programmable Poisson’s ratio types, and Voronoi diagram designs based on implicit functions. Studying numerical homogenization methods for thermal conductivity, elasticity, and thermal expansion properties, and establishing a surrogate model database. Completing topology optimization methods for multi-level composite structures under thermo-mechanical coupling. Performing transient thermo-mechanical coupling analysis based on homogenized material properties. Selecting appropriate lattice types for large-scale sample part filling design based on project requirements.
