description: >-
  This project focuses on the design of multi-level composite lattice sandwich structures for strong laser protection, incorporating surface coating, thermal insulation filling, and a metallic skeleton. The goal is to achieve a structure that combines resistance to laser thermal ablation and mechanical failure, while also ensuring lightweight, load-bearing, and integrated thermal protection. This structure aims to enhance the laser resistance of aerospace vehicles, missile defense systems, and other equipment.
My project responsibilities are Design lattice unit cells, including TPMS types, typical bar-type structures, programmable Poisson’s ratio types, and Voronoi diagram design based on implicit functions. Study numerical homogenization methods for thermal conductivity, elasticity, and thermal expansion properties, and establish a surrogate model database. Complete topology optimization methods for multi-level composite structures under thermo-mechanical coupling. Perform transient thermo-mechanical coupling analysis based on homogenized material properties. Select suitable lattice types for large-scale sample part filling design based on project requirements.
