description: >-
  Shock Absorption and Rebound in Footwear is a hot topic in sports biomechanics and ergonomics. This project explores various topological forms of metamaterials and lattices, investigates metamaterial and lattice filling methods, and develops a mechanical performance evaluation method for lattices considering superelasticity. Based on vibration damping and rebound performance, a lattice design database has been created, selecting the optimal lattice unit with the best rebound characteristics.
  My project responsibilities are: Research metamaterial lattice design methods, conduct numerical simulations and evaluations of lattice units considering superelasticity, and develop an inverse adaptive filling design based on the stress field.
